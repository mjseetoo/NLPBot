Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the engineering art and science of how to teach computers to understand
human language. NLP is a type of artificial intelligence technology, and it’s now ubiquitous – NLP lets us talk to
our phones, use the web to answer questions, map out discussions in books and social media, and even translate
between human languages. Since language is rich, ambiguous, and very difficult for computers to understand,
these systems can sometimes seem like magic – but these are engineering problems we can tackle with data, math,
and insights from linguistics.

1.1 Course Objective
This course will introduce NLP methods and applications including probabilistic language models, machine trans-
lation, and parsing algorithms for syntax and the deeper meaning of text. During the course, students will (1)
learn and derive mathematical models and algorithms for NLP; (2) become familiar with key facts about human
language that motivate them, and help practitioners know what problems are possible to solve; and (3) complete
a series of hands-on projects to implement, experiment with, and improve NLP models, gaining practical skills for
natural language systems engineering.
By the end of the semester students will:
• Acquire the fundamental linguistic concepts that are relevant to language technology.
• Analyze and understand state-of-the-art algorithms and statistical techniques for reasoning about linguistic
data.
• Implement state-of-the-art algorithms and statistical techniques for reasoning about linguistic data.
• Adapt and apply state-of-the-art language technology to new problems and settings.
• Read and understand current research on natural language processing.
• Exercise public speaking skills by discussing various course topics with classmates, asking and answering
questions, and doing group presentations.
By the end of this course students should be able to transfer the knowledge gained, and apply it outside of the
context of the course to:
• Identify, formulate, analyze, and solve complex computing or engineering problems by applying principles of
computing, engineering, science, and mathematics.
• Design, implement, and evaluate a computing or engineering solution to meet a given set of requirements,
with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and
economic factors.
• Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts, with a range of audiences.
• Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s
discipline, creating a collaborative and inclusive environment, establishing goals, planning tasks, and meeting
objectives.
1.2 Prerequisites
• For CSCI 4140: CSCI 2540 Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented Data Structures, MATH 2228 Elementary
Statistical Methods I, or MATH 2283 Statistics for Business.
• For CSCI/DASC 6040: enrolled in the master of science in computer science, data science, or software
engineering programs or consent of instructor.

• Optional: Speech and Language Processing (SLP) – an introduction to natural language processing, compu-
tational linguistics, and speech recognition.
